## how 2 build if yo dumb

0. [dependers](https://github.com/siduck/st#dependencies)

- including gd (build with png support)
- or just disable it in config.mk if you dont wanna

1. clone it lol

```
git clone https://github.com/GravityShark0/st-grav-flexipatch.git && cd st-grav-flexipatch
```

2. and go an build it and stuff

```
# make clean install
```

3. then hide your trace from the government

```
rm -fr * && rmdir ../st-grav-flexipatch
```

## how 3 use kinda

### the only shortcuts you are probably gonna use (just look in config.def.h for the others)
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Down</kbd> decrease font size by 2
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Up</kbd> increase font size by 2
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Home</kbd> reset font size to default
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> enter keyboard selection ([bindings](./patch/keyboardselect_reflow.txt)

### set themes

uhhh like

```
xrdb merge <theme path>
```

so yeah it can include other files and shit, and also install xrdb if you havent

### apply themes while terminals are still on

you just do like and it kinda works

```
killall -USR1 st
```

so yeah you can do it at once too

```
xrdb <path> && killall -USR1 st &
```

### edit make yo own themes

go read theme files or something, go copy and make a new one, you can figure it out yourself

### Might add

> Some patches were selected not for need but it sounded cool. I could make another version with only essential patches but im lazy

st - simple terminal
--------------------

Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:
